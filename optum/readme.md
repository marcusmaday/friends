# Optum

- Optum is using Tekton to create our own custom CI/CD GitOps platform that we hope to release as OSS.
- We have contributed back to the triggers project and are interested in staffing people to continue to contribute to many Tekton projects.
- We are most interested in contributing to the triggers project so that it can support a wide variety of use-cases.  We would like to make it possible for people to build complex orchestration platforms on Tekton without abandoning the excellent Triggers project.
- We love the flexibility and portability that Tekton gives us and hope to leverage that to keep our CI/CD functionality decoupled from other enterprise suites (GitHub/GitLab/...)
